## Improving the Sparse Matrix package in Scipy
### Abstract

The project has two main parts, adding support for the bool dtype, and having better interaction with numpy. Adding bool support will start by writing a specification, implementing it along with a test suite. After this, attention will turn to Sparse Matrices interactions with other python/numpy types. The goal is functional parity with numpy's ndarrays and matrix objects.
